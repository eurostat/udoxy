### About... {#about}

There is not much to say about it. 

These webpages aim at demonstrating how to build documentation from various distributed, _e.g._ stand-alone, 
programs, whatever the language used for the implementation. The structure of the documentation is actually
totally independent of the organisation of the source code and can be configured by the user.   

Further somehow unrelated reading is available here:
